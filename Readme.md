## *Week 6 → CodeIgniter (Advanced)*

* Authentication (login system with CI)
* Form validation
* Pagination + File Uploads
* Helpers & Libraries

*Mini Project:*
 
Blog CMS in CodeIgniter (login + CRUD + categories)

---

## *Week 10 → Integration & Final Projects*

Combine all skills and build a bigger project.

*Final Project Ideas:*

1. *E-Commerce Website (PHP/CodeIgniter) + Android App (API connected)*
2. *Blog CMS in CodeIgniter + Android App (fetch blog posts via API)*
3. *Student Management System (Java OOP + Web App + Android)*

*Pro Tip:*
Focus on *API design + connection + UI/UX basics* – this will be your *portfolio showpiece*.

---

### Notes & Tips:

1. *Mini Projects First* → Always build small before going big.
2. *Version Control* → Push projects to *GitHub* weekly.
3. *Time Management* → If Android/CI topics seem heavy, split day into *learning + practice*.
4. *Portfolio Ready* → Week 10 projects should be deployable online if possible.
