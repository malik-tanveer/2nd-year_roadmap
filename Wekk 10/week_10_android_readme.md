# Week 10 - Android Development: Final Integration Projects

This README.md is a **complete Day-wise guide for Week 10** of your Android development learning. Follow it carefully to master full project integration combining Android apps with backend APIs and web services.

---

## **Day 1: Backend Setup (PHP / CodeIgniter)**
**Goal:** Prepare backend for Android app.

- Install **XAMPP/WAMP** for local server
- Create new project in **CodeIgniter**
- Set up **database** (MySQL)
- Create tables for your project (e.g., Products, Users, Blogs)
- Create basic **API endpoints** using REST:
  - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

**Task:** Create Users table + Products table with basic API endpoints.

---

## **Day 2: API Testing + Integration**
**Goal:** Test APIs before connecting with Android.

- Use **Postman** to test GET & POST requests
- Verify data sent & received correctly
- Fix any errors in API logic

**Task:** Ensure all API endpoints are working correctly and returning proper JSON.

---

## **Day 3: Android App - API Fetch**
**Goal:** Connect Android app with backend.

- Add **Retrofit library** to project
- Create **API interfaces** in Android
- Fetch data from API and display in RecyclerView / ListView
- Handle JSON parsing and errors

**Task:** Display product/blog list fetched from backend in Android app.

---

## **Day 4: Android App - Detail Screens & Navigation**
**Goal:** Navigate and show details.

- Add **second screen** to show details of selected item
- Use **Intents** to pass data between screens
- Ensure smooth navigation and back stack handling

**Task:** Click on a product/blog → open detail screen with full info.

---

## **Day 5: Authentication**
**Goal:** Add login/logout functionality.

- Create **login screen**
- Authenticate using API (POST request)
- Save login session using **SharedPreferences**
- Handle logout

**Task:** Implement login/logout for your Android app connected with backend.

---

## **Day 6: Full App Flow & Testing**
**Goal:** Ensure everything works together.

- Test all screens, API calls, and database interactions
- Fix any crashes or errors
- Make sure RecyclerView, navigation, login, and API integration work smoothly

**Task:** Complete end-to-end app flow.

---

## **Day 7: Final Touches + Portfolio Ready**
**Goal:** Prepare app for showcase.

- Polish UI: colors, fonts, spacing, card layouts
- Test on emulator and real device
- Push project to **GitHub**
- Take **screenshots and videos** for portfolio
- Document code and APIs used

**Task:** Make final app **portfolio ready**, showcase all skills learned from Week 8–10.

---

## **Pro Tips for Week 10**
- Start early: backend + Android integration can take time
- Test APIs frequently
- Keep UI simple and clean
- Push code frequently to GitHub
- Take notes of errors & fixes
