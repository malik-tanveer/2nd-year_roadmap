# Week 9 - Android Development: Database & API

This README.md is a **complete Day-wise guide for Week 9** of your Android development learning. Follow it carefully to master database handling and API integration in Android apps using Java.

---

## **Day 1: SQLite Basics**
**Goal:** Understand local database in Android.

- Learn **SQLiteOpenHelper** class
- Create a **database** and **table**
- Insert data into table using `ContentValues`
- Query data using `Cursor`
- Update and delete records

**Task:** Build a small Notes table in SQLite and insert few sample notes.

---

## **Day 2: Notes App UI**
**Goal:** Build UI for Notes App.

- Create a screen with **RecyclerView** to display notes
- Add **Add Note** button and input dialog
- Use **CardView** or simple layout for list items

**Task:** Design a Notes App UI, static data for now.

---

## **Day 3: Notes App Functionality**
**Goal:** Connect UI with SQLite database.

- Fetch notes from SQLite and display in RecyclerView
- Add new note to database from input
- Delete note from database

**Task:** Build fully working Notes App with CRUD operations.

---

## **Day 4: SharedPreferences**
**Goal:** Learn to save user data locally without DB.

- Save simple data like **login status**
- Retrieve saved preferences on app start
- Update preferences when needed

**Task:** Create a simple Login App that remembers user login using SharedPreferences.

---

## **Day 5: API Calls - Retrofit Basics**
**Goal:** Learn to fetch data from internet.

- Add **Retrofit library** to project
- Create **API interface**
- Send **GET request** to public API
- Receive and parse JSON response

**Task:** Fetch a list of quotes or simple JSON data from an online API.

---

## **Day 6: Weather App (API + UI)**
**Goal:** Combine API + UI for real app.

- Input city name
- Fetch weather data using Retrofit
- Display temperature, condition, and other info
- Use RecyclerView or simple layout for forecast list

**Task:** Build a simple Weather App that shows weather data for a city.

---

## **Day 7: Project Polishing**
**Goal:** Improve Notes & Weather App.

- Handle errors: network errors, empty data
- Improve UI: card layouts, colors, fonts
- Add Swipe to Delete (RecyclerView) for Notes
- Ensure apps run smoothly on emulator and real device

**Task:** Make both apps **user-ready** and visually appealing.

---

## **Day 8: Mini Review + GitHub Upload**
**Goal:** Review week learning & create portfolio-ready code.

- Go through Notes App and Weather App code
- Comment important code parts
- Push apps to **GitHub**
- Take screenshots for portfolio showcase
- Make note of important concepts learned

**Tip:** Always keep small projects documented. Week 9 is **real-world skill week**, focus on database + API integration.

---

**End of Week 9:**
By the end of this week, you should be able to create Android apps with **local database (SQLite)**, save preferences (SharedPreferences), and fetch & display **data from APIs**. These apps can be used in your **portfolio for showcasing skills**.
